2. **Video Content Details**:
   - Provide a list of 5 elements for the video category.
   - Each element should include:
     - **Description**: What the video clip should depict, including visual elements, animations, or transitions.
     - **Text Overlay**: Text that appears on the screen to reinforce the message.
     - **Voiceover**: A short voiceover script that aligns with the visuals and conveys the key message.

3. **Image Content Details**:

   - Describe the memeâ€™s visual elements and the humorous or viral aspect.
   - Include a **Text Overlay** that adds to the meme's humor or message.

   - **Name**: The name of a trending song relevant to the topic and region.
   - **Artist**: The artist's name. Ensure the song is popular and culturally relevant.

6. **Engagement Strategy**: Incorporate features to encourage engagement, such as hashtags, call-to-actions (e.g., 'tag a friend', 'share your opinion'), or challenges (e.g., a trending dance or meme challenge).

7. **Format for Virality**: Ensure the content design maximizes shares and engagement, utilizing popular social media formats like challenges, polls, reactions, or humor. Avoid content that could evoke negative emotions or controversy.
